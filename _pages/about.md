<!-- Research Scientist | Computational Fluid Dynamicist

Welcome! I am a Research Scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston, USA. Originally specialized in Computational Fluid Dynamics and High Resolution Turbulence Simulation, I am now interested in the field of Computational Oceanography.

As I studied both Physics and Computer Science, my methods are mostly computational. My undergrad theses were on Deep Inelastic Scattering with Boson Exchange and Interference, then Fault Injection for Robustness Testing of Satellite On-Board Image Processing (at the German Aerospace Center), and finally Analyzing the Network Effects of Computationally Generated Low Traffic Neighborhoods (at NERDS, ITU Copenhagen).

Inbetween, I interned at the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management at TU Delft, The Netherlands, to gain experience in the field of active mobility and transport safety.

As of now, I am assisting with a research project at PLUS (ETH Zurich) in context of ValPar.ch, exploring the impact of future climate scenarios on biodiversity and ecosystem services in Switzerland. -->

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
