Research Scientist | Computational Fluid Dynamicist

Greetings, and welcome to my professional portfolio. I am a Research Scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston, USA, specializing in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and High-Resolution Turbulence Simulation. 

My academic journey includes earning a PhD from Delft University of Technology, where my research focused on Direct Numerical Simulation of high temperature participating flows.
Employing the CUDA programming, I implemented state-of-the-art methods for spectral directional radiation in participating gases. This effort resulted in a deep understanding of turbulence-radiation interactions, culminating in the development of a sophisticated parameterization for high temperature engineering flows.

Presently, my research interests have shifted to computational oceanography. As one of the main contributors to Oceananigans.jl, a computational software integral to the CliMA climate model, I am dedicated to advancing our comprehension of oceanic dynamics. I am particularly enthusiastic about the advancement of computational modeling of the ocean, including high-order numerical methods and algorithmic developments.  -->

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
